An operating system, or OS, is fundamental software that manages computer hardware and software resources while providing essential services for computer programs. It effectively schedules tasks and facilitates interaction between programs and hardware. Operating systems are present in a wide array of devices, from cell phones to supercomputers. Key features include process management, memory management, file systems, device drivers, networking, security, and input and output functions.

In the personal computer market, Microsoft Windows holds a dominant position with sixty-eight percent market share, followed by MacOS at twenty percent and Linux distributions at seven percent. In the mobile sector, Android leads with over sixty-eight percent, while Apple's iOS and iPadOS account for approximately thirty percent.

There are several types of operating systems. Multicomputer systems use multiple processors sharing memory or clusters with individual memory, common in cloud computing. Distributed systems consist of networked computers, each with its own OS, enhanced by middleware. Embedded systems, designed for Internet of Things devices, avoid user-installed software for simplicity. Real-time operating systems ensure timely processing for critical applications like avionics. Virtual machines operate as applications on other OSs, enhancing portability for development and debugging.

Historically, early computers lacked modern OS features, with significant advancements beginning in the nineteen fifties and progressing in the nineteen sixties, exemplified by IBM’s OS/360. Unix and Unix-like systems, originally written in assembly language, have evolved significantly, influencing contemporary designs. Linux, though separately derived, powers a variety of devices.

Microsoft Windows, introduced in nineteen eighty-five, evolved from an MS-DOS-based system to one using the NT kernel. It is prevalent in desktop computers, with Windows Server versions competing with Linux and BSD in server markets. Other notable operating systems include AmigaOS, OS/2, Classic Mac OS, BeOS, Z/OS for IBM mainframes, and OpenVMS, with academic systems like MINIX supporting educational purposes.

Crucial OS components include the kernel, firmware, and device drivers that manage hardware control, memory, resource allocation, CPU optimization, and data storage. The OS coordinates program execution, creating processes, and ensuring smooth interactions between application programs and hardware.

Interrupts enable operating systems to respond swiftly to external events, allowing efficient resource allocation and task coordination through context switching and task scheduling. File systems manage permanent storage, facilitating data access and integrity through directories and device drivers.

Security features in operating systems protect data and resources from unauthorized access and attacks using privilege separation and access controls. Graphical user interfaces are integral to human-computer interaction, supported by input devices like keyboards and touchscreens.

Hobbyist operating systems are often created for specific needs or experimentation, sometimes leveraging new or pre-existing concepts. Efforts to reduce diversity and increase portability focus on platform-agnostic solutions such as Java and frameworks like Qt, which promote broader application compatibility through standards like Portable Operating System Interface, known as POSIX. Understanding these aspects is vital for designing effective operating systems, optimizing performance, and enhancing user experience across different computing platforms.
